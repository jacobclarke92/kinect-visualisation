#TODO

### Immediate, concerning functionality

* Get the node server working on windows / find a solution to stream [intrael](https://code.google.com/p/intrael/) seems very promising
* Potentially switch from image streaming to raw depth data for higher depth precision than 0-255 [this](http://blog.mackerron.com/2012/02/03/depthcam-webkinect/) seems like a good solution
* Consider re-introducing Processing.JS purely for 3D effects
* Improve MIDI mapping capabiities -- UI overhaul imminenet
* Size stage to window size / fill to an aspect ratio, instead of 640x480


### Future endeavours
* Look into using [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) for sweet sweet physics-based effects
* Beat detection / BPM punch in for more reliable audio cues
* Implement a more robust method of getting outlines -- [blob detection](http://blog.acipo.com/blob-detection-js/)
* Make a heap of effects!

* Expand upon audio/FFT anaysis
	* implement a way to map frequency ranges to other variables -- similar to how VJ program Resolume works
